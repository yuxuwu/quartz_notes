# quartz_notes
These are my personal notes on Unreal Engine's Quartz Subsystem, mostly about its implementation internally for the purposes of extending Quartz by writing Plugins or Engine modifications to add or alter functionality.

This will probably never be completed, since it's mainly meant to help aid my own foray into time sensitive events in Unreal.

Quartz will be shorted to just 'Q' for this documentation.

The documentation is in the Wiki tab.
